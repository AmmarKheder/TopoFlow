# Rossice: "---------"

**Rossice** is a customized fork of [ClimaX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10343), designed to integrate and fine-tune foundation weather models on high-resolution air pollution reanalysis data from the [CAQRA](https://www.scidb.cn/en/detail?dataSetId=696756084735475712) dataset (China Air Quality Reanalysis).  
This project aims to adapt ClimaX to pollution-specific variables such as **PM₂.₅**, **O₃**, **NO₂**, and more, using a spatial resolution of **0.1° (~10 km)**.

## 🎯 Project Objective

> *Fine-tune a general-purpose climate model (ClimaX) on high-resolution atmospheric pollutant fields over China using CAQRA, with a focus on prediction and representation of urban-scale pollution dynamics.*

Goals:
- Evaluate the adaptability of ClimaX on environmental pollutant data
- Incorporate pollutant-specific variables as model targets (e.g. PM₂.₅, NO₂, O₃)
- Enable training on finer spatial resolutions (0.1°) not originally used in ClimaX

## 📝 Reference

This project builds upon:

> **Huang et al. (2024)**  
> *A High-Resolution Reanalysis Dataset of Air Pollutants over China.*
